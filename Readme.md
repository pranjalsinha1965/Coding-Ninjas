### Web Frameworks: setting up a project

### Q.1 What are frameworks ? 
Let`s take a simple example of a project and all. 

Frameworks are, in short, libraries that help you develop your application faster and smarter! Nowadays, the number of Web Frameworks has increased greatly.

### What are MVCs(Models, Views and Controllers) ? 

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects. 

The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. It is the representation of information or data that you want to display to user. Model gets all these data from database and data can be read, updated and deleted.

It is all the front end code via which the website is presented in front of the user. It includes all the CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Any ajax is called in view. Using view, the user interacts with the website.

For example, if a user wants to see their profile, view will send the request to controller, in controller the code to read the profile will execute and send a request to model. After this model will return the requested data by controller will display the data via view to the user.

to understand right now, but donâ€™t worry. These are just for giving
you brief idea of other frameworks and how they work)
